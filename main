'''1. Key Features of Python That Make It a Popular Choice for Programming
Python is widely appreciated for several reasons:

Readability and Simplicity: Python's syntax is clear and intuitive, making it easy to learn and use. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, often using English keywords rather than punctuation.
Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language, suitable for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.
Large Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that supports many common programming tasks, like working with data formats, file I/O, and internet protocols.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python can run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), which makes it highly portable.
Extensive Community Support: Python has a large and active community, with numerous tutorials, documentation, and third-party libraries that extend its capabilities.
Dynamic Typing and Memory Management: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t have to declare the data type of a variable. It also handles memory allocation and garbage collection automatically.
2. The Role of Predefined Keywords in Python
Python has a set of reserved words, known as keywords, that have specific meanings and functions within the language. These keywords are part of the language syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).

Examples of Keywords:

if, else, elif: Used for conditional statements.
for, while: Used to create loops.
def: Used to define a function.
return: Used to exit a function and optionally pass an expression back to the caller.
True, False: Boolean values used in logical operations.
Example:
'''
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is 10 or less")
'''
3. Mutable and Immutable Objects in Python
Mutable Objects: These are objects whose state or content can be changed after creation. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Example:

'''
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # The list is now [10, 2, 3]

'''
Immutable Objects: These are objects whose state or content cannot be changed once created. Examples include strings, tuples, and integers.

Example:

'''
my_string = "hello"
my_string[0] = "H"  # This will raise a TypeError since strings are immutable
Comparison:

'''Lists (Mutable):

'''
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
'''
Tuples (Immutable):
'''
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError
'''
4. Different Types of Operators in Python
Python supports various operators that are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example:
'''
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Output: 13
print(x - y)  # Output: 7
print(x * y)  # Output: 30
print(x / y)  # Output: 3.333...
'''
Comparison Operators: Compare two values and return a boolean (True or False).

Example:
python
'''
print(x > y)  # Output: True
print(x == y)  # Output: False
'''
Logical Operators: Combine conditional statements.

Example:
'''
print(x > y and x < 20)  # Output: True
print(x < y or x > 20)  # Output: False
'''
Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.

Example:
'''
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
'''
Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on the binary representations of integers.

Example:
'''
print(x & y)  # Output: 2
'''
5. The Concept of Type Casting in Python
Type casting in Python refers to the conversion of one data type to another. It can be done implicitly by Python or explicitly by the programmer.

Implicit Type Casting: Python automatically converts one data type to another without any user intervention.

Example:
'''
x = 10
y = 3.5
z = x + y  # x is implicitly converted to float, so z becomes 13.5
'''
Explicit Type Casting: The programmer manually converts a value from one type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.

Example:
'''
x = "123"
y = int(x)  # Converts string to integer
print(y)  # Output: 123

'''
6. How Do Conditional Statements Work in Python?
Conditional statements in Python allow the program to take different actions based on certain conditions.

if Statement: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
else Statement: Executes a block of code if the if condition is false.
elif Statement: Checks multiple conditions, executing the first true block.
Example:

'''
x = 10
if x > 15:
    print("x is greater than 15")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not more than 15")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
'''
7. Different Types of Loops in Python
Python supports two main types of loops:

for Loop: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

Example:
'''
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
'''
while Loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Example:
'''
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
'''
Use Cases:


for Loops: Useful when you know the number of iterations in advance.
while Loops: Useful when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.
